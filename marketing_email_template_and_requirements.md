✨ Project Requirements


📌 Requirement #1

Top 2 Categories
For each customer, we need to identify the top 2 categories based on their past rental history.

These top categories will drive marketing creative images.
Examples include travel and sci-fi as seen in the draft email.


📌 Requirement #2

Category Film Recommendations
The marketing team has requested 3 most popular films for each customer's top 2 categories (excluding already viewed films).

🔹 Rules:

If there are less than 3 films available, marketing is fine with recommending at least 1 film.
Customers with no film recommendations for either category must be flagged so they can be excluded from the email campaign (this is of high importance!).


📌 Requirement #3 & #4

Individual Customer Insights
📍 Top Category Insights (Requirement #3)

For the 1st category, marketing requires:

🎬 Total number of films watched in this category.
📊 How many more films the customer has watched compared to the average DVD Rental Co customer.
🏆 Customer ranking in the top X% compared to all other customers in this film category.
📍 Second Category Insights (Requirement #4)

For the 2nd category, marketing requires:

🎞️ Total number of films watched in this category.
🔢 Proportion of total films watched (rounded to 0 decimal places).


📌 Requirement #5

Favorite Actor Recommendations
Along with the top 2 categories, marketing has also requested top actor film recommendations:

Up to 3 additional films should be recommended.
The total count of films watched by the top actor should be included.
🔹 Rules:

If multiple actors have the same film count, choose the actor in alphabetical order.
(e.g., If a customer has watched 5 Brad Pitt films and 5 George Clooney films, Brad Pitt will be chosen first.)
Any films already recommended in the top 2 categories must not be included in the actor recommendations.
Customers with no actor recommendations must be flagged separately for exclusion.


🎯 Final Notes

✔️ Ensure all calculations are accurate.
✔️ Follow the specified rounding rules.
✔️ Customers with no recommendations should be properly flagged.

🚀 Let's build a powerful recommendation system!
